# AI-for-Reading-Handwritten-Receipts-Expense-Extraction-
# 🧾 AI for Reading Handwritten Receipts (Expense Extraction)

## 📌 Project Summary

This project aims to automate the extraction of structured expense information—specifically item names and corresponding prices—from handwritten or printed receipts. The solution leverages the power of **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **image preprocessing techniques using OpenCV**. By processing raw receipt images, the system is capable of generating clean, accurate, and organized data outputs for personal or business expense tracking.

It solves a highly practical problem—managing receipts and expenses—while showcasing applied skills in computer vision, text extraction, and information parsing.

## 💡 Problem Statement & Motivation

Receipts, whether printed or handwritten, are commonly used in daily transactions. However, manually recording and tracking receipt data is tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with large volumes for business reimbursements, personal budgeting, or taxation purposes.

This project addresses that problem by:

- Automating the reading of receipts.
- Extracting relevant financial data like item names and prices.
- Generating structured expense lists that can be stored or integrated into personal finance systems.

This system is not only helpful for individuals but also highly applicable in **fintech solutions**, **accounting software**, and **budgeting tools**.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🧾 Read both **handwritten and printed** receipts.
- 🧠 Use **OCR and NLP** for intelligent parsing of text.
- 📊 Output a **structured list** of items and prices.
- 🛠️ Capable of handling **image noise, rotation, and poor lighting**.
- 💼 Useful in **fintech**, **corporate reimbursements**, and **personal finance apps**.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies

### 🧠 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- **Tesseract OCR** is used to detect and extract text from images of receipts.
- Pretrained models are used and fine-tuned if necessary.

### 🧰 Image Processing with OpenCV
- Grayscale conversion
- Adaptive thresholding
- Noise removal
- Contour detection and cropping
- These techniques enhance text clarity and improve OCR accuracy.

### 📚 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Regular expressions and rule-based parsing are applied to the extracted text.
- The parser identifies item names, quantities, and prices.
- Post-processing includes filtering irrelevant text and formatting output data.

## 📦 Datasets

### 📁 Primary Dataset:
- **SROIE (Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction)**  
  This dataset includes scanned receipt images with labeled data for entity recognition such as item names and prices.

### 📁 Supplementary Datasets:
- **Kaggle Receipt Datasets**  
  Additional printed and handwritten receipts are used for testing generalizability.

These datasets ensure diversity in receipt formats, languages, and writing styles, enabling the model to perform robustly in real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Image Input**  
   The user uploads an image of a receipt, which can be either handwritten or printed.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   OpenCV is used to clean the image: convert to grayscale, remove noise, apply thresholding, and align the image.

3. **Text Extraction (OCR)**  
   The cleaned image is passed through Tesseract to detect and extract text regions.

4. **Text Parsing (NLP)**  
   Extracted text is parsed to locate product names and prices. Custom logic is used to ignore headers, tax info, or irrelevant text.

5. **Output Formatting**  
   The parsed data is converted into a structured format (JSON/CSV) for export, visualization, or further use in applications.

## 🧠 Unique Angle

While OCR and receipt processing are not new, combining **OCR + NLP + OpenCV** to work with **handwritten as well as printed** receipts makes this project uniquely practical. It focuses on:

- High accuracy under challenging input conditions (e.g., wrinkled receipts, cursive handwriting).
- Flexibility across multiple receipt formats and vendors.
- Readiness for integration into consumer finance or corporate reimbursement systems.

---

## 📈 Potential Enhancements

- 🔍 Add **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** models for more accurate extraction of store names, totals, dates, and tax info.
- 💰 Classify expenses into categories like food, travel, utilities using NLP.
- 🌍 Detect currency and localize totals using locale-aware formatting.
- 📱 Build a mobile interface for scanning receipts in real-time.
- 🔁 Integrate with budgeting apps like Mint, YNAB, or Excel for end-to-end expense tracking.

---

## 💼 Use Cases

- Personal finance tracking
- Corporate expense reporting
- Tax preparation and auditing
- Receipt archiving systems
- Mobile banking or budgeting tools
